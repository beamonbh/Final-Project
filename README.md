# Final-Project
___This program runs out of the Main.java file.___
First, a menu will appear to prompt you to create a game. The menu will close and then the program will run within the Console,
ask you to print your Name to start.  After four players are created the game will begin.

__Basic Rules__ 
You will start at the Home Tile that is at the beiginning of the screen.  If you get a sorry card you must choose who goes back to home.  
The object of the game is to get through to the Finish Tile, and be able to ge your name written amongst the gods!  Enjoy and have a 
wonderful time.



##Issues##
The major issue with the program at this point is that the Pawns do not change with on the board.  Also their are some kinks in how to 
remove a pawn that is already on a tile space.  Im sure their are other miniscule errors that I ahve over looked and if you stumble upon
any others please inform, and or fix the problem.  Thanks.

##Notes##
I would like you to regrade the File IO protion of my code.  It is located in the game.java class. Also I would like my UML documentation 
to be regraded. I will be working on this more after it has been turned in to truly finalize the code and possibly add more gui 
instructions.
